# TicTacMas

**Intelligence System Project by astaga.ai. Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia**

This project is inspired by the classic `Tic Tac Toe` game. The game is designed with Indonesian folklore `Timun Mas` as the theme of the game.

A `Minimax` algorithm is implemented in this project and we also apply `Alpha-Beta Pruning`. We also create this for 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 board game that you can choose, with 3 different difficulities: easy, medium, and hard.

This game is written with Vanilla HTML+CSS+JavaScript and Love.
